# s2functions
 A project that will help people with certain functions that are harder to find as they are hashed.

The entire point of this project is that the game has hashed most of the gsc functions in s2.
I have been doing research into the files to name them as i work on a project, and I was trying to think of a way to store it.
I will not be providing help with using the functions, however if you notice a genuine bug, or an incorrect function, let me know so that I can change it.

Everything in these files will be tested. The reason i chose a csv format, is because it is better to view in a csv, and keeps things organized.

This is the intial commit, and i'm just starting off on this project.
This project is not afiliated with infinity loader, but is going to be a functional library for variables and functions.

I do not have a timeframe on this, as I am defining everything manually. If you wish to contribute, you can fork it and work off of yours.
