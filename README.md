 The file is large because of the dlls used to maintain the webview client, the webview from microsoft is no longer supported, cefsharp does a good job in providing a better library than windows webview did. The entire exe is about 20 lines.

The entire point of this project is that the game has hashed most of the gsc functions in s2.
I have been doing research into the files to name them as i work on a project, and I was trying to think of a way to store it.
I will not be providing help with using the functions, however if you notice a genuine bug, or an incorrect function, let me know so that I can change it.

Everything in these files will be tested. The reason i chose a csv format, is because it is better to view in a csv, and keeps things organized.

This is the intial commit, and i'm just starting off on this project.
This project is not afiliated with infinity loader, but is going to be a functional library for variables and functions.

I do not have a timeframe on this, as I am defining everything manually. If you wish to contribute, you can fork it and work off of yours.
